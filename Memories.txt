Remember outside the apartment when the houses looked HUGE and scary. Or when the stripes of the crosswalk looked like black and white jail bars.
The 4 little ghost holograms that appeared sitting inside my server at Port Richey house. The hologram that appeared in my campire outside the house. The television mesmerizing me to climb into it. "You're a monkey." The ape trapped with a robot face -- keeping it alive but it wanted to die. The ghost image that appeared in the shower marble that looked like it was holding back a meatball man with a gun to his head. Being abducted in the shower and covering my ears and waterboarding myself in the shower. Or going outside and standing under the lightpost. The other lightposts in the front of port richey house. The enchanted, divine white light from my photo lights. When God came to talk to me and bless me at Kitanas and console me when I was abandoned. Dancing with them in the house, The Tupac. Talking to me when I drove to The Space Center. The entire trip at the space center -- even parking overnight. Dumpster diving.
When I was really high when I was younger and thought the tv was talking to me, or was paranoid. I think they were trying to scare me straight. Like a spirit guide. It is so powerful you can be delusional and fully immersed in it - and physical reality simultaniously.
